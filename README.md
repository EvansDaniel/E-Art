The site was built by Daniel Evans, implementing all of the PHP and MySQL procedures, and Blaise Iradukunda, implementing all of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/JQuery functionality. We are students at University of the South in Sewanee, TN. You can find Blaise's github account here https://github.com/Blezzoh

We believe that college artists deserve more recognition for their work, and since most artists aren't computer science nerds too,
we decided to build a site that gives artists a place to sell their art and become more well known. That's why our site features a fully customizable page (in terms of styling) for each artist that contains all there products so that they can market their art in a way that fits their personality and artistic style. Then, when customers find a piece of art they want to buy, they have the option to visit artist's product page and check out more of their art. 

In the future, we will create a top ten artists of the week section shown on the home page as well as many, many more features. This will help the best college artists become well known and give each artist a chance to reach their artistic potential.
